This markdown is used to examine the MaxEnt model outputs for the NW CASC PNW Fishes Project. A good primer on MaxEnt can be found [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x) (Merow et al. 2013).  

``` {r message = F, warning = F, echo = F}

# Methods:  
## I. Occurrence Data Prep:   
Occurrence data is the same dataset used for the final RCS runs. This includes data from several sources, including GBIF. The data was filtered as follows...  
1. Remove records with missing data and/or flags (e.g., *date mismatch*)  
2. Remove records with matching latitude + longitude + year  
3. Remove records outside the PNW extent (WA, OR, ID with a 10 km buffer as below)  
```{r study extent, echo=F, fig.cap="Study extent used to filter datasets.", out.width='60%', out.height='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/Projects/PNW_fishes/code/Figures/pnw_extent_buff.png")
```
4. Remove records outside and predating the predictor set date range (1995-2015)  
5. Remove records identified as 'climate outliers' (> 3 stdev from mean) using PRISM and PROSPER variables  
6. Remove records as identified by expert ichthyologists  
`r cat("\n")`
## II. Environmental Predictor Prep:  
All predictors were clipped to the study extent and extracted to NHDplus HR flowlines. Multi-year variables (e.g., *PROSPER*) were averaged to a single value for the flowline.  
Extraction for raster variables was done (depending on the variable) either by **a)** taking the mean of all cells falling within a 500 m buffer, weighted by area of cell within the buffer (e.g., *canopy cover*), or **b)** taking the mean of all cells falling within the HUC12 watershed the NHD flowline falls within, weighted by area of cell within the watershed (e.g., *percent land cover*). Variables were only retained if they had -0.7 < r < 0.7 pearson correlation coefficient (except for the time being, mean sum. annual flow + mean summer low flow).  
`r cat("\n")`  
```{r corr plot, echo=F, message=F, eval=F}

**Final environmental predictors used in all models were:**  
`r env.var$Variable`  
`r cat("\n")` 

```{r echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
library(kableExtra)

vi.list <- list.files(path = paste0(PATH, "/SDM/Output/Results_Tables"), pattern = "VarImp.csv", full.names = T)
vi.all <- lapply(vi.list, read.csv)
vi.all <- bind_rows(vi.all)

vi.all.s <- vi.all %>% 
  left_join(., env.var %>% select(Variable.Name, Variable), by = c("variable"="Variable.Name")) %>%
  select(-variable) %>%
  group_by(Variable) %>%
  mutate(mn_var_imp = mean(permutation.importance, na.rm = T),
         max_imp = max(permutation.importance, na.rm = T),
         min_imp = min(permutation.importance, na.rm = T),
         mn_cont = mean(percent.contribution, na.rm = T),
         max_cont = max(percent.contribution, na.rm = T),
         min_cont = min(percent.contribution, na.rm = T),
         across(.cols = where(is.numeric), ~ round(.x, digits = 2))
         ) %>%
  select(Variable, contains("mn"), contains("max"), contains("min")) %>%
  distinct()

knitr::kable(vi.all.s, 
             col.names = c("Env. Variable", "Mean Permutation Importance", "Mean % Contribution", "Max Permutation Importance", "Max % Contribution", "Min Permutation Importance", "Min % Contribution"), 
             caption = "\\label{tab:var_cont}Summary of environmental predictor importance across all species' selected top models.",

```
Variable contributions across  all species' models can be found in Table \ref{tab:var_cont}.  
More details for this step can be found in the script: **01_EnvironData_SetUp.R**  
`r cat("\n")`

## III. Model Runs  
### A. Background Points  
For each species, background 'points' were selected by either **a)** randomly selecting NHD flowlines within all HUC12 watersheds occurrence points fell within + 50 km buffer (*spatially controlled background points*), or **b)** randomly selecting NHD flowlines within the convex hull of all presence points + 50 km buffer. The target was **10,000** background points, however the number of NHD streams available with the constraints was sometimes less than 10,000.  
`r cat("\n")`  
More details on background point creation can be found in: **02_Occ_Bg_SetUp.R**  

### B. Model Parameters  

``` {r model load, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
mx <- readRDS(list.files(path = paste0(PATH, "/SDM/Output/Model_RDS"), full.names = T)[[1]])
```

For each species, the following **regularization multipliers** were used: `r unique(mx@tune.settings$rm)`  
The following **feature classes** were used: `r unique(mx@tune.settings$fc)`  
A total of `r nrow(mx@tune.settings)` models were created for each species.  

### C. Model Selection  
The "top" model for each species was selected by the highest CBI values (Continuous Boyce Index), with the tie breaker as highest AUC value. Information on CBI is summarized [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/ecospat/man/ecospat.boyce.html).  
The top model was used to create a prediction of habitat suitability across flowlines in either **a)** the species range (IUCN range map) + 10 km buffer or **b)** a convex hull of the species' filtered occurrence points + 50 km buffer. *Note: All model outputs were predicted using* **b** *based on J. Dunham feedback.*  
`r cat("\n")`  

# Results:  
*Note:* `r ifelse(b.t == "SpCont", "Models below created with spatially controlled background points", "Models below were created with randomly selected background points")`  
For all maps, the flowlines with > 0.8 probability of being suitable habitat are shown, with > 0.9 highlighted. In addition, bar plots show the habitat suitability probability across flowlines with known occurrences as one visual of how good/bad predictions are.
